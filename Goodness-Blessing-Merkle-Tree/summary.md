# Summary

A Merkle Tree is a data structure used in blockchain to efficiently and securely verify the contents of large datasets. It consists of leaf nodes, which are hashes of individual data blocks, and non-leaf nodes, which are hashes of their child nodes. The topmost node is called the root hash. Merkle Trees are important in blockchain because they allow for quick and secure verification of data integrity without needing to check the entire dataset.
